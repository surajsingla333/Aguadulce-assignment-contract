# Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

## Deployment steps


```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test # To run test suites
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test # To run test suites
npx hardhat node # To run a local hardhat node for deployment
npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.ts # run the deployment and initial setup scripts for the NFT and auction contracts
```
