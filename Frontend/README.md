# Frontend

This folder consists of the Frontend web app for the assignment. 

Using the application, the continent owners would be able to put continents on Auction, and transfer continents to the other users.

The non-owners would be able to bid in the auction and view all live auctions and continents.

The users will need to connect with their metamask wallets to perform the above tasks.
